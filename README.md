#### *I am a driven, passionate technologist combining logic, interpersonal skills, and a team-player orientation. I have 2+ years of experience working in both startups and established technology companies, developing in agile work environments using industry standard technologies and workflows. I am inspired by technology, and actively follow trends in web technology, incorporating them into projects to optimize them whenever and wherever possible. My current personal interests/hobbies include blockchain/smart contracts, video games, music, film, and IOT.*
